		<p1>
			These are problems in the community that I feel strongly about.

		<ul>
            
            <li>
				Neighborhoods, during Independence Day, need to have less illegal and noisy fireworks.
            </li>
            <li>
				<img src="http://cdn2-www.cattime.com/assets/uploads/2017/03/should-feral-cats-be-tamed-4.jpg" style="padding:10px">Feral cats should be prevented from coming into yards because they leave feces and fleas wherever they go.
            </li>
            <li>
				There should be more trains but shorter so that people donâ€™t have to wait a long time if they are running late.
            </li>
            <li>
				Police officers should be trained more in dealing with people of color.
            </li>
            <li>
				Computer workers and coders need faster computers with more storage because they always have to do things in a limited time.
			</li>
